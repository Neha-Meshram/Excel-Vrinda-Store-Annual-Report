Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2023 so that the store can understand its marketing strategy and grow more sales in 2023.
Analysis:
First of all, I understood the data in the data sets and find the business problems.
I did data cleaning to remove duplicates and null values and made an Age group column from the Age column using the IF function.
Created a Pivot table to summarize the data and create charts and graphs to solve business problems.
At Last, I have built a dashboard in Excel with slicers so that users can interact with the dashboard and view it in different ways to get results.
